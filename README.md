This project demonstrates various feature engineering techniques to improve the performance of machine learning models. It covers the complete process from data preprocessing to feature transformation, creation, and selection.

ðŸ“Œ Feature Engineering on Loan Approval Dataset

This project demonstrates feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques on a loan approval dataset. The PDF walks through the complete process of preparing raw data for machine learning, including:

1) Data Cleaning

2) Dropping unnecessary columns (like Loan_ID)

3) Handling constant columns and duplicates

4) Treating missing values using mean, median, or mode

5) Handling Outliers

6) Detecting outliers using boxplots & distributions

7) Applying transformations (Log, Square Root, Box-Cox) to normalize skewed data

8) Encoding Categorical Variables

9) Label Encoding (for ordinal data like Married, Education)

0) One-Hot Encoding (for nominal data like Gender)

11) Manual encoding (for Property_Area)

12) Scaling & Feature Transformation

13) Creating new features (ApplicantIncome_log, CoapplicantIncome_sqrt)

14) Ensuring data is ready for ML models

15) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

16) Visualizations using Seaborn & Matplotlib to understand feature relationships

17) Checking target distribution (Loan_Status) across different categories

# Jupyter Notebook for interactive development :-

** Explaination about the project :-
--> First I have taken the data from the kaggle known as loan_approved.csv
--> Then I have processed Eda which is used for cleaning the data and also removed duplicate and null values , the  I use displot to check if it is normally distributed and if not then again clean it, after that Ii have prrforme outlier and removed it as it will give incorrect data, and then i have import scipy to import boxcox and then i have used sckitlearn to import ordinal encoder and build a model.
