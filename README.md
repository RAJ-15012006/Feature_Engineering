ðŸ“Š Feature Engineering for Machine Learning
This project demonstrates various feature engineering techniques to improve the performance of machine learning models. It covers the complete process from data preprocessing to feature transformation, creation, and selection.

ðŸ”¹ Features
1) Data Cleaning â€“ Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2) Feature Transformation â€“ Scaling, normalization, encoding categorical variables.

3) Feature Creation â€“ Deriving new meaningful features from existing data.

4) Feature Selection â€“ Removing redundant or less important features using statistical and model-based methods.

5) Dimensionality Reduction â€“ PCA, LDA, and other techniques.

Model Evaluation â€“ Assessing performance before and after feature engineering:-

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
1) Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

2) Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

3) Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
